# Firmware Downgrade
In case there is a need to downgrade the Firmware you pretty much follow the same steps as Firmware upgrade.
Do it with the newest alpha manager or you can try the offline updater from here [Base Offline Updater](/assets/files/alpha/Base_Offline_Updater.zip)


You will also need some old version of the Firmware

{% for firmware in site.static_files -%}
    {% if firmware.path contains '/assets/files/firmware/alpha/' %}
- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ firmware.path }}">Version {{firmware.basename}}<a/>
    {%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}
