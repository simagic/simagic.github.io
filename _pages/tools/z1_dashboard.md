The Z1 dashboard is definitely made for hardware,
the designs looks phenomenal,
the editor is quirky, but it actually works.
There is a plethora of pre-made designs which really are very good.
The editor is a very strange piece of work, I never really got my head around it,
but that should not deter you, it's all round a good product.
If I use the Z1 Dashboard, I usually just utilise some default dash, and run with that.
The only painpoint for me was, they have no android app,
so you have to connect with a browser to your desktop hosting the dash.
This works quite well, but introduces unnecessary lag.
I think for a data display, for example standings, yeah totally good awesome, but not as a dash on a mobile phone.
