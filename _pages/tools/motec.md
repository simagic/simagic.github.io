One free tool which really is awesome for analysing telemetry data is Motec i2 Pro. 
As far as I know Motec mostly works with Assetto Cosa Competizione and iRacing.
There is no way for Motec to integrate directly into games (because it's a tool used to read real car data)

I quite like using it to look at data, but it's quite difficult to use.
