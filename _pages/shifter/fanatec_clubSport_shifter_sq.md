# Review
Generally a good H and Sequential shifter.
Sadly not compatible with Simagic Base so has to be used with its own <a href="https://fanatec.com/eu-en/accessories/pedal-accessories/clubsport-usb-adapter" target="_blank">USB connection<a/>

Mostly known for it's H shifter capabilities, most people prefer a real sequential shifter over the ClubSport SQ.
However, if you're on a budget and want both H and Sequential, or you just lack the space, it's a good investment.
Especially because of it's interesting design which enables you to attach for example a handbrake directly to the side of the shifter.
