# Unofficiall Simagic Documentation (and other trivial things)
Some time ago I started focusing a bit more on Sim Racing.  
Since I needed to build up some quite specific knowledge, especially when it comes to Simagic,
I decided to document my journey a little bit.  
I try to be quite active on the official Simagic Discord, and can usually be found there.
Other than that, I hope this site helps you with Simagic products, or other random sim racing things.


You may want to check [Getting Started](/base/getting_started/) or directly go to base settings.
